# ProgrammingChallenge

Technologies and Libraries used:
1. HTTPClient - Access the web service
2. Autofac - Dependency injection
3.Newtonsoft.Json - Convert json to object
4. Moq - for unit test


Notes: I used dependency injection to make unit test writing easy. I had some issues with mocking HTTPClient. I didn't implement any workarounds for that issue.
